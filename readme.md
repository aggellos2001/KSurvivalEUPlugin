## KSurvivalEU Plugin

##### What's this?
It's a rewrite in Kotlin from my old plugin [SurvivalEUPlugin](https://github.com/aggellos2001/KSurvivalEUPlugin)  
It's being used on my small survival server that I host for fun and to improve my coding skills.  
Any improvements or suggestions are always welcome.  
You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aggellos2001) for any information.
